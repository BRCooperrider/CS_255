## Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPass project is one where Liam, the owner, noticed a lot of young drivers were failing their driver tests. He decided to think of a way to help them succeed, in the form of DriverPass, which is a Learning Management System(LMS). They wanted the system to be designed so students can take courses and tests in order to be more prepared for their driving tests, making them more likely to succeed.

## What did you do particularly well?
I believe I was able to analyze what DriverPass wanted out of their system well. There wasn't a whole lot of moving parts but even for more simple software, there are a lot of design choices and considerations that go on behind the scenes.

## If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would go back and revise my UML diagrams. I'm still new at designing them so I did the best I could at the time, but I feel as if I could improve them even more. Possibly arrange them better, and add more functions to them.

## How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted the user's needs by reading the passages over and over and writing down functionalities they wished to have. It is important to consider the user's needs because we want to create the piece of program or software as close as possible to what they envision.

## How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
My apprach to designing software is to determine what functionality it needs from the start, and develop it iteratively. Making software bit by bit is a lot more manageable with a plan in mind. For future pieces I make, I will develop UML diagrams to examime all the moving parts of the software and put it together.
